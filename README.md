# Clean-Topology

A python CLI script to clean up spare nodes
and edges in a PostGIS topology.
This is a generalization of [Sandro Santilli's
QGIS plugin](https://github.com/strk/
qgis_pgis_topoedit) for the same purpose.

Command-line usage is simple:
```bash
> clean-topology --db syrtis --topology map_topology
```
